# Image-Analysis-Election-Prediction-Project
This is a repository of my machine learing project that uses facial images of political candidates to predict their success. This repository includes non-finalized versions of the machine learning program and the dataset that I used.
Link to my dataset, file size was too big for Github (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raymonddeminglin/us-and-cn-candidates-facial-images-2000-present)
